The algorithm produces second-order accurate solutions and first-order accurate gradients in the L∞-norm on Cartesian grids. The condition number is bounded, regardless of the ratio of the diffusion constant and scales like that of the standard 5-point stencil approximation on a rectangular grid with no interface. Numerical examples are given in two and three spatial dimensions.}

abstract = {We introduce an approach for simulating epitaxial growth by use of an island dynamics model on a forest of quadtree grids, and in a parallel environment. To this end, we use a parallel framework introduced in the context of the level-set method. This framework utilizes: discretizations that achieve a second-order accurate level-set method on non-graded adaptive Cartesian grids for solving the associated free boundary value problem for surface diffusion; and an established library for the partitioning of the grid. We consider the cases with: irreversible aggregation, which amounts to applying Dirichlet boundary conditions at the island boundary; and an asymmetric (Ehrlich–Schwoebel) energy barrier for attachment/detachment of atoms at the island boundary, which entails the use of a Robin boundary condition. We provide the scaling analyses performed on the Stampede supercomputer and numerical examples that illustrate the capability of our methodology to efficiently simulate different aspects of epitaxial growth. The combination of adaptivity and parallelism in our approach enables simulations that are several orders of magnitude faster than those reported in the recent literature and, thus, provides a viable framework for the systematic study of mound formation on crystal surfaces.}

abstract = {High-dimensional PDEs have been a longstanding computational challenge. We propose to solve high-dimensional PDEs by approximating the solution with a deep neural network which is trained to satisfy the differential operator, initial condition, and boundary conditions. Our algorithm is meshfree, which is key since meshes become infeasible in higher dimensions. Instead of forming a mesh, the neural network is trained on batches of randomly sampled time and space points. The algorithm is tested on a class of high-dimensional free boundary PDEs, which we are able to accurately solve in up to 200 dimensions. The algorithm is also tested on a high-dimensional Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman PDE and Burgers' equation. The deep learning algorithm approximates the general solution to the Burgers' equation for a continuum of different boundary conditions and physical conditions (which can be viewed as a high-dimensional space). We call the algorithm a “Deep Galerkin Method (DGM)” since it is similar in spirit to Galerkin methods, with the solution approximated by a neural network instead of a linear combination of basis functions. In addition, we prove a theorem regarding the approximation power of neural networks for a class of quasilinear parabolic PDEs.}

abstract = {We present a level set method on non-graded adaptive Cartesian grids, i.e. grids for which the ratio between adjacent cells is not constrained. We use quadtree and octree data structures to represent the grid and a simple algorithm to generate a mesh with the finest resolution at the interface. In particular, we present (1) a locally third order accurate reinitialization scheme that transforms an arbitrary level set function into a signed distance function, (2) a second order accurate semi-Lagrangian methods to evolve the linear level set advection equation under an externally generated velocity field, (3) a second order accurate upwind method to evolve the non-linear level set equation under a normal velocity as well as to extrapolate scalar quantities across an interface in the normal direction, and (4) a semi-implicit scheme to evolve the interface under mean curvature. Combined, we obtain a level set method on adaptive Cartesian grids with a negligible amount of mass loss. We propose numerical examples in two and three spatial dimensions to demonstrate the accuracy of the method.}

abstract = {A level set approach for computing solutions to incompressible two-phase flow is presented. The interface between the two fluids is considered to be sharp and is described as the zero level set of a smooth function. We use a second-order projection method which implements a second-order upwinded procedure for differencing the convection terms. A new treatment of the level set method allows us to include large density and viscosity ratios as well as surface tension. We consider the motion of air bubbles in water and falling water drops in air.}

abstract = {We present a semi-Lagrangian method for advection–diffusion and incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The focus is on constructing stable schemes of second-order temporal accuracy, as this is a crucial element for the successful application of semi-Lagrangian methods to turbulence simulations. We implement the method in the context of unstructured spectral/hp element discretization, which allows for efficient search-interpolation procedures as well as for illumination of the nonmonotonic behavior of the temporal (advection) error of the form: O(Δtk+Δxp+1Δt). We present numerical results that validate this error estimate for the advection–diffusion equation, and we document that such estimate is also valid for the Navier–Stokes equations at moderate or high Reynolds number. Two- and three-dimensional laminar and transitional flow simulations suggest that semi-Lagrangian schemes are more efficient than their Eulerian counterparts for high-order discretizations on nonuniform grids.}
