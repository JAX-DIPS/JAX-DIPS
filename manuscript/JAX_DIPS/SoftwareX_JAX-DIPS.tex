Ca. 100 words

This work presents a software package for solving elliptic partial differential equations with jump conditions across irregular interfaces using neural network surrogate models. The differentiable interfacial PDE solver, dubbed \texttt{JAX-DIPS}, is purely developed in \texttt{JAX} \cite{jax2018github} and offers end-to-end differentiability from mesh generation to the higher level discretization abstractions, geometric integrations and interpolations, thus facilitating research into differentiable algorithms for developing hybrid PDE solvers. We release \texttt{JAX-DIPS} as an open-source software package under MIT license that is available for download at \href{https://github.com/JAX-DIPS/JAX-DIPS}{https://github.com/JAX-DIPS/JAX-DIPS}
